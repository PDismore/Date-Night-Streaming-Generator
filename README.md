## Description

The project one asignment required us to make an app/website using two third party API's. We used the IMDB API as well as Watchmode API to get a result of a desired film as well as showing the user where they may go to watch the title.

This was accomplished with use of JS, Jquery, styled with Tailwind, and the combined teamword of the group.
